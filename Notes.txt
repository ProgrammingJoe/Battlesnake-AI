1. Make grid for pathfinding, mark snakes, any locations
   that they can potentially move to as obstructed
2. Check if food exists that no other snake can get to faster
Yes ->
    1. Pathfind to food
    2. Make grid with cells as if our snake took the path as obstructed
    3. Check paths to random cells from food, if a certain ratio of paths away are
       blocked, assume food is a dead end
    Yes ->
        Go on path towards food
    No ->
        |
        v
        
No -> Do some sort of idle state, wasting moves, but avoiding obstacles (possibly
    just pathfinding to random cells
